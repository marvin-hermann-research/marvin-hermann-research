# Marvin Hermann – Research Portfolio

**Computer Science Student @ KIT | Focus: AI, Robotics, ROS & Python**

*I aspire to explore how machines might one day connect with humans not just through logic, but through empathy and emotion.*

Welcome to my research portfolio.

This repository serves as a central hub to document my ongoing learning journey, projects, and accumulated knowledge in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence.

### Major Project Lines

These are my primary, long-term research directions, designed to be developed iteratively over multiple years. They form the backbone of my work in robotics and AI, providing continuity and focus across experimental, conceptual, and applied projects.

I am currently developing two core research series:

- [AETHER Series](https://github.com/marvin-hermann-research/aether-framework-overview.git):
Modular software framework for robotic locomotion, task management, and sensor-actuator integration. Focused on bipedal and quadrupedal robots, behaviour trees, and scientific reproducibility.

- [ARTIFICE Series](https://github.com/marvin-hermann-research/artifice-series-overview.git):
Modular quadrupedal robotic platforms, designed for autonomous mobility, terrain adaptation, and future emotional AI integration. Serves as a physical embodiment of advanced robotic research.

## Masterposts

These are living documents that I continuously update to reflect my growing expertise.

[Masterposts Overview](https://github.com/marvin-hermann-research/masterposts).  

Examples include:  
- [ROS Masterpost – A Complete Synthesis on Designing Interactive Systems with ROS2](https://github.com/marvin-hermann-research/masterposts/blob/main/ros2_engineering_notes.md)  
- [Python Masterpost – A Practical Guide to Writing Clean and Maintainable Code](https://github.com/marvin-hermann-research/masterposts/blob/main/python_for_robotic_engineering.md)

## Current Learning Projects

I am actively developing modular robotic systems using ROS2 and Python, with a focus on sensor integration, autonomous control, and behavior orchestration through Behavior Trees. These projects serve as practical explorations of robotics architecture.

The latest project is a [AETHER I - Modular Behaviour Tree Architecture for ROS2](https://github.com/marvin-hermann-research/ros2-architecture-lab.git), demonstrating a research-driven, extensible framework for robot locomotion.

## Weekly Logs

I maintain weekly logs documenting my learning process, coding sessions, problem-solving experiences, and next steps.  
They serve both as personal reflection and as transparent insight into my development path.  

Find them here: [Weekly Logs](https://github.com/marvin-hermann-research/weekly-logs)

## Legacy Projects
These projects are personal and academic projects of mine from earlier stages of my journey.
