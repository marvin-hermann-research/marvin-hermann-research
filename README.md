# Marvin Hermann – Research Portfolio

**Computer Science Student @ KIT | Focus: AI, Robotics, ROS & Python**

*I aspire to explore how machines might one day connect with humans not just through logic, but through empathy and emotion.*

Welcome to my research portfolio.

This repository serves as a central hub to document my ongoing learning journey, projects, and accumulated knowledge in the fields of robotics and artificial intelligence.
